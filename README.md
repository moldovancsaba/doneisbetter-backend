# Express.js Hello World Application

## Description
This is a simple Express.js application that serves as a starting point for the Done Is Better project. The application responds with "Hello World!" when accessed through the root URL (`/`).

## Installation
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd doneisbetter/backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To run the application locally, use one of the following commands:

```bash
node server.js
```
or if configured in package.json:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default, and you can access the "Hello World!" message by navigating to the root URL in your browser.
